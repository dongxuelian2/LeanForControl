# Minimal realizations

Minimality is stated semantically: no behaviorally equivalent realization
with the same input and output dimensions has fewer states. The principal
rank argument in this file proves that every controllable and observable
realization is minimal.

/-- A controllable and observable realization is minimal.

The proof compares a common finite Hankel matrix across an arbitrary
behaviorally equivalent competitor. The first realization gives that Hankel
matrix rank n; factorization through the competitor bounds the same rank by
the competitor's state dimension.
